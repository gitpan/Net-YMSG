Note: Currently you will be logged in Linux room(by default) , You can change it
by changing the $chatroom and $chatroomid in the executable "yahoo";
Refer to  Yahoo Chat Protocol for chatroom names and id. 

Common Problems: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. On executing yahoo, you get the error 'bad interpretor'
> Change the first line of file yahoo, to point wherever your perl
> executable is. The first 2 lines should look like: 
#!path-to-perl
use lib qw(/path-to-the-current-directory/Yahoo/YMSG_libs/ ); 
(Sometimes the char '\n' is present, replace it by the 'return-character') 

2. User '' message box is full.  will have to login and clear out their message
box before any more messages can be stored. Please try sending your message 
later.
> You did not enter a valid 'receiver' ID [ or did not enter any id].
> Set the 'receiver' ID using '/id YAHOO-ID' or '/num message'. 
> Type /h for help.
